Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Perhaps the most breathtaking feature of Meadowhead Barn is the light and space that is found within. The erstwhile hayshed is now the main sitting room - about 40 ft long and light and airy with its Velux windows and a French door to the garden. Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Perhaps the most breathtaking feature of Meadowhead Barn is the light and space that is found within. The erstwhile hayshed is now the main sitting room - about 40 ft long and light and airy with its Velux windows and a French door to the garden. Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Perhaps the most breathtaking feature of Meadowhead Barn is the light and space that is found within. The erstwhile hayshed is now the main sitting room - about 40 ft long and light and airy with its Velux windows and a French door to the garden. Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Perhaps the most breathtaking feature of Meadowhead Barn is the light and space that is found within. The erstwhile hayshed is now the main sitting room - about 40 ft long and light and airy with its Velux windows and a French door to the garden. Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Perhaps the most breathtaking feature of Meadowhead Barn is the light and space that is found within. The erstwhile hayshed is now the main sitting room - about 40 ft long and light and airy with its Velux windows and a French door to the garden. Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.

Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Perhaps the most breathtaking feature of Meadowhead Barn is the light and space that is found within. The erstwhile hayshed is now the main sitting room - about 40 ft long and light and airy with its Velux windows and a French door to the garden. Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.

The erstwhile hayshed is now the main sitting room - about 40 ft long and light and airy with its Velux windows and a French door to the garden. Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.

Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Perhaps the most breathtaking feature of Meadowhead Barn is the light and space that is found within. The erstwhile hayshed is now the main sitting room - about 40 ft long and light and airy with its Velux windows and a French door to the garden. Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Perhaps the most breathtaking feature of Meadowhead Barn is the light and space that is found within. The erstwhile hayshed is now the main sitting room - about 40 ft long and light and airy with its Velux windows and a French door to the garden. Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Perhaps the most breathtaking feature of Meadowhead Barn is the light and space that is found within. The erstwhile hayshed is now the main sitting room - about 40 ft long and light and airy with its Velux windows and a French door to the garden. Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Perhaps the most breathtaking feature of Meadowhead Barn is the light and space that is found within. The erstwhile hayshed is now the main sitting room - about 40 ft long and light and airy with its Velux windows and a French door to the garden. Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Perhaps the most breathtaking feature of Meadowhead Barn is the light and space that is found within. The erstwhile hayshed is now the main sitting room - about 40 ft long and light and airy with its Velux windows and a French door to the garden. Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Perhaps the most breathtaking feature of Meadowhead Barn is the light and space that is found within. The erstwhile hayshed is now the main sitting room - about 40 ft long and light and airy with its Velux windows and a French door to the garden. Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Perhaps the most breathtaking feature of Meadowhead Barn is the light and space that is found within. The erstwhile hayshed is now the main sitting room - about 40 ft long and light and airy with its Velux windows and a French door to the garden. Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Perhaps the most breathtaking feature of Meadowhead Barn is the light and space that is found within. The erstwhile hayshed is now the main sitting room - about 40 ft long and light and airy with its Velux windows and a French door to the garden. Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.

Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Perhaps the most breathtaking feature of Meadowhead Barn is the light and space that is found within. The erstwhile hayshed is now the main sitting room - about 40 ft long and light and airy with its Velux windows and a French door to the garden. Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Perhaps the most breathtaking feature of Meadowhead Barn is the light and space that is found within. The erstwhile hayshed is now the main sitting room - about 40 ft long and light and airy with its Velux windows and a French door to the garden. Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.

Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Perhaps the most breathtaking feature of Meadowhead Barn is the light and space that is found within. The erstwhile hayshed is now the main sitting room - about 40 ft long and light and airy with its Velux windows and a French door to the garden. Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Perhaps the most breathtaking feature of Meadowhead Barn is the light and space that is found within. The erstwhile hayshed is now the main sitting room - about 40 ft long and light and airy with its Velux windows and a French door to the garden. Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.

Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Perhaps the most breathtaking feature of Meadowhead Barn is the light and space that is found within. The erstwhile hayshed is now the main sitting room - about 40 ft long and light and airy with its Velux windows and a French door to the garden. Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Perhaps the most breathtaking feature of Meadowhead Barn is the light and space that is found within. The erstwhile hayshed is now the main sitting room - about 40 ft long and light and airy with its Velux windows and a French door to the garden. Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.

Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Perhaps the most breathtaking feature of Meadowhead Barn is the light and space that is found within. The erstwhile hayshed is now the main sitting room - about 40 ft long and light and airy with its Velux windows and a French door to the garden. Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Perhaps the most breathtaking feature of Meadowhead Barn is the light and space that is found within. The erstwhile hayshed is now the main sitting room - about 40 ft long and light and airy with its Velux windows and a French door to the garden. Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.

Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Perhaps the most breathtaking feature of Meadowhead Barn is the light and space that is found within. The erstwhile hayshed is now the main sitting room - about 40 ft long and light and airy with its Velux windows and a French door to the garden. Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Perhaps the most breathtaking feature of Meadowhead Barn is the light and space that is found within. The erstwhile hayshed is now the main sitting room - about 40 ft long and light and airy with its Velux windows and a French door to the garden. Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.

Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Perhaps the most breathtaking feature of Meadowhead Barn is the light and space that is found within. The erstwhile hayshed is now the main sitting room - about 40 ft long and light and airy with its Velux windows and a French door to the garden. Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Perhaps the most breathtaking feature of Meadowhead Barn is the light and space that is found within. The erstwhile hayshed is now the main sitting room - about 40 ft long and light and airy with its Velux windows and a French door to the garden. Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.

Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Perhaps the most breathtaking feature of Meadowhead Barn is the light and space that is found within. The erstwhile hayshed is now the main sitting room - about 40 ft long and light and airy with its Velux windows and a French door to the garden. Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Perhaps the most breathtaking feature of Meadowhead Barn is the light and space that is found within. The erstwhile hayshed is now the main sitting room - about 40 ft long and light and airy with its Velux windows and a French door to the garden. Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.

Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Perhaps the most breathtaking feature of Meadowhead Barn is the light and space that is found within. The erstwhile hayshed is now the main sitting room - about 40 ft long and light and airy with its Velux windows and a French door to the garden. Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Perhaps the most breathtaking feature of Meadowhead Barn is the light and space that is found within. The erstwhile hayshed is now the main sitting room - about 40 ft long and light and airy with its Velux windows and a French door to the garden. Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.

Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Perhaps the most breathtaking feature of Meadowhead Barn is the light and space that is found within. The erstwhile hayshed is now the main sitting room - about 40 ft long and light and airy with its Velux windows and a French door to the garden. Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.

Its wood burning stove (more efficient than an open fire and just as atmospheric) and oil-fired central heating keep the whole place warm and cosy.

At the far end of the room there are two daybeds and the overall size of the place means that two extra tenants can be accommodated with ease (at a small additional charge).

The well-fitted and equipped kitchen-diner certainly lives up to the average farmhouse in terms of space. It too faces south, as does the large double bedroom. The bathroom has a separate shower. Being all on one level, Meadowhead Barn is a good choice for those of limited mobility.
Barn it may be called, it was once stacked floor to ceiling with hay after all, but it's now like no barn you've ever seen!

On the edge of the village of Dolphinton on the Peeblesshire-Lanarkshire border, within a half hour drive of Edinburgh and an hour of Glasgow, Meadowhead is an imposing sandstone country house. It stands in 11 acres of gardens with fine views across a valley, where an old walled garden has been carefully restored, to the hills and woods on the other side.

Meadowhead Barn adjoins the house, but is quite private and self-contained, with its own sun trap parterre garden (with furniture). Its privacy is ensured by a wall and high yew hedge on two sides and to the front there is your own slice of that lovely view.
